# get_clean_data_proj
Course Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera Course.  

The file run_analysis.R is a script that does the following:  

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the UCI_HAR_Dataset.
3.  Returns a summary data set which contains the mean (average) of each variable (from #2) by subject for each activity.  

The out put is saved as summary_data.csv
